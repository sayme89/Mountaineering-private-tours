# SummitBound — Static Website (Private Mountaineering Tours)

This is a small static site scaffold to promote private mountaineering tours. It includes basic pages, responsive CSS, and a tiny JS file for navigation and form validation.

Files included:
- `index.html` — landing page
- `tours.html` — tour details
- `contact.html` — contact / booking form (uses Formspree placeholder)
- `assets/css/style.css` — site styles
- `assets/js/main.js` — small interactivity helpers
- `assets/images/` — add your photos here (not included)

Quick setup:
1. Replace placeholder text, email, and example URLs in the HTML files.
2. Add your images to `assets/images/` and update `<img>` tags or background styles as needed.
3. Replace Formspree action (`https://formspree.io/f/your-form-id`) with your Formspree ID, Netlify form configuration, or a server endpoint to handle requests.
4. Host on GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel.

SEO & accessibility tips:
- Update meta description and title tags for each page.
- Add alt attributes to all images.
- Replace JSON-LD `url` and `telephone` with real values.

Deploy:
- GitHub Pages: push to `main` and enable Pages in repo settings.
- Netlify: drag & drop or connect the repo for automatic deploys.
- Vercel: connect repo and deploy.

If you'd like, I can:
- Add a gallery page with lazy-loaded photos.
- Wire up Netlify Forms or Formspree with example IDs.
- Create social meta tags (Open Graph, Twitter Card).
- Generate print-ready flyers or a PDF itinerary template.

Tell me which of those you'd like next and any brand colors/logos you want applied.
